# 🧩 ToSDR-RAG: Understanding Terms & Conditions through RAG

## 📖 Problem Description

Most people never read the **Terms & Conditions** or **Privacy Policies** when signing up for online services.  
These documents are often **long, complex, and full of legal jargon**, making it difficult for users to understand what rights they might be giving up or what data might be collected about them.

As a result, users routinely agree to policies that:
- Allow broad data sharing or tracking,
- Contain hidden clauses about arbitration, liability, or data retention,
- Differ significantly between companies without users realizing it.

This project addresses this problem by building a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system based on the **Terms of Service; Didn’t Read** dataset that allows users to:
- **Ask natural language questions** (e.g., “Does this app share my data with third parties?”)
- **Compare multiple services** side by side based on their terms or privacy policies
- **Get concise, LLM-generated summaries** that highlight potential risks or user rights.

By doing so, ToSDR-RAG aims to make digital consent **transparent, accessible, and understandable**, empowering users to make informed choices about the services they use.
